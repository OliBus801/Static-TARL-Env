# Static-TARL-Env

**Static-TARL-Env** is a lightweight experimental environment designed to evaluate reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms on their ability to solve the **Static Assignment Problem (SAP) of Traffic** under the **System Equilibrium** formulation proposed by Warwick.

It provides a standardized framework to:

* run static traffic assignment simulations;
* store and process simulation outputs;
* evaluate the performance of RL methods on this problem.

## 🚀 Goals

* Provide an environment compatible with RL frameworks to simplify the evaluation of RL algorithms on the Static Traffic Assignment Problem.
* Facilitate fair comparison between different approaches.
